# Bank Document Parsing System - Project Requirements

## Project Overview

A single-page Django web application that helps banks organize and digitize document data through two main processing methods:

1. Photo/image analysis of paper documents
2. Processing of disorganized text files

The system extracts structured data and converts it into organized Excel, PDF, and DOC formats.

## Core Functionality

### Input Processing Methods

**Method 1: Image/Photo Analysis**

- Upload and process images of paper documents
- Extract text using OCR (Tesseract)
- Parse extracted text using multimodal LLM

**Method 2: Text File Processing**

- Upload disorganized text files
- Process and structure the content using LLM

### Supported Input Formats

- **Images**: JPG, PNG, PDF (scanned documents)
- **Text**: TXT files
- **File Size**: No specific limit defined (implement reasonable defaults)

### Document Types (Liberal Support)

The system should handle various bank documents including:

- Bank statements
- Loan applications
- Customer forms
- Receipts
- Account opening documents
- Transaction records
- Identity verification documents
- Financial reports

## Data Extraction Requirements

### Target Data Fields

Extract and structure the following information when present:

- **Personal Information**: Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses
- **Financial Data**: Account numbers, amounts, balances, transaction details
- **Dates**: Transaction dates, document dates, due dates
- **Identifiers**: Customer IDs, reference numbers, document numbers
- **Institutional Data**: Bank names, branch information, routing numbers

### Output Format

- Data must be presented in **table format** or **key-value pairs**
- Structure should be logical and easily readable
- Include confidence levels or error indicators where applicable

## Output Generation

### Supported Output Formats

1. **Excel (.xlsx)** - Structured spreadsheet with proper columns and formatting
2. **PDF (.pdf)** - Professional document layout with tables and formatting
3. **DOC (.docx)** - Word document with structured content

### Template Requirements

Create basic templates for each output format:

- **Excel**: Tabular format with headers, data validation, basic formatting
- **PDF**: Clean layout with company header, structured tables, proper spacing
- **DOC**: Professional document format with headers, tables, and consistent styling

## Technical Architecture

### Framework & Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Django (Python web framework)
- **OCR Engine**: Tesseract OCR
- **LLM Integration**: Multimodal Large Language Model for text parsing and analysis
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript (single page application)
- **File Storage**: Free cloud storage compatible with Django (recommend: AWS S3 Free Tier, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudinary)

### Database Requirements

- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL-based cloud database)
- **Simple data model** - no complex database operations
- Store basic file metadata and processing results
- Track processing status and timestamps
- Leverage Supabase's built-in authentication and real-time features if needed

### Session Management

- Track user sessions for cleanup and maintenance purposes
- Implement automatic cleanup of inactive sessions
- Maintain session state across requests

## User Interface Requirements

### Single Page Design

- **File Upload Area**: Drag-and-drop interface for images and text files
- **Processing Method Selection**: Toggle between image analysis and text processing
- **Progress Indicator**: Show processing status and progress
- **Results Display**: Preview extracted data in table format
- **Download Section**: Buttons to download Excel, PDF, and DOC versions
- **Error Display**: Clear error messages and suggestions

### User Experience

- Simple, intuitive interface
- No user authentication required
- Responsive design for desktop and tablet use
- Clear visual feedback for all operations

## Error Handling & Validation

### OCR + LLM Error Management

- When Tesseract fails to extract clear text, pass unclear content to LLM
- LLM should return structured error responses indicating:
  - Unreadable sections
  - Low confidence areas
  - Suggested manual review points
- Display errors clearly to users with actionable guidance

### File Processing Errors

- Invalid file format handling
- File size limit exceeded
- Corrupted file detection
- Network/storage errors

## Performance & Scalability

### Current Requirements

- **No specific performance requirements**
- Process files synchronously (no background queue needed initially)
- Handle typical bank document sizes efficiently

### Processing Flow

1. File upload and validation
2. OCR processing (for images)
3. LLM analysis and data extraction
4. Data structuring and formatting
5. Output file generation
6. Download delivery

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection

- Secure file upload handling
- Temporary file cleanup after processing
- No persistent storage of sensitive document content
- HTTPS enforcement for all communications

### Input Validation

- File type verification
- Size limit enforcement
- Malicious file detection
- Content sanitization

## Future Roadmap

### Phase 2 Enhancements

- **Data Validation Rules**: Implement format checking for account numbers, routing numbers, etc.
- **User Authentication**: Multi-user support with role-based access
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple files simultaneously
- **Advanced Templates**: Customizable output templates
- **API Integration**: RESTful API for external system integration
- **Audit Trail**: Processing history and compliance logging
- **Advanced OCR**: Integration with cloud OCR services for better accuracy

### Phase 3 Considerations

- **Machine Learning**: Custom model training for bank-specific documents
- **Workflow Management**: Approval processes and document routing
- **Integration**: Connect with existing bank systems
- **Mobile App**: Native mobile application for field document capture

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

- Follow Django best practices
- Implement proper error handling
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Include basic documentation and comments

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for file processing pipeline
- Manual testing for UI components
- Error scenario testing

### Deployment

- Docker containerization recommended

- Cloud deployment ready (AWS, GCP, or Azure)
- Basic monitoring and logging

## Success Criteria

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

- Successfully process images and text files
